1. BasicCollisionStrategy Receiving GameObjectCollection
We believe the best approach to managing the list of game objects is Option 2: delegating the responsibility
of adding or deleting objects to the GameObjectCollection class exclusively. This ensures that the
encapsulation principle is adhered to in the best way possible.

Advantages of the Design Choice (Managing the Object List Exclusively via GameObjectCollection):
1) Separation of Concerns:
    Managing the collection of game objects is centralized in a single class, simplifying the tracking of
    changes and avoiding code duplication.

2) Encapsulation Principle:
    The object list is managed privately within the GameObjectCollection, hiding implementation details from
    other classes. This makes it easier to modify the underlying data structure or logic without affecting
    external code.

3) Improved Maintainability:
    All modifications to the list are handled in one place, reducing the risk of bugs and making the code
    easier to maintain and extend.

4) Code Reusability:
    By encapsulating the logic within GameObjectCollection, other components of the system can reuse its
    functionality without needing to duplicate code.

Disadvantages of the Design Choice:

1) Increased Complexity in GameObjectCollection:
    Centralizing all logic may make the GameObjectCollection class more complex as it grows to accommodate
     various use cases.

2) Dependency on GameObjectCollection:
    Other classes are tightly coupled to the GameObjectCollection's interface, meaning changes to its API
    could impact multiple components.

5. Explain why we added the getTag public method to all the game objects:
We added the getTag public method to all game objects to facilitate identifying the type of object when
iterating through the game object list. This allows us to manage the behavior of each object appropriately
based on its tag. Using a tag name for identification eliminates the need for the instanceof operator,
which is generally considered bad practice due to its impact on code flexibility and maintainability.
